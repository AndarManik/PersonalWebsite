        <div class="about">
          <p>
            Welcome! I'm Andar M. Manik, a dedicated Software and Web Developer
            passionate about crafting innovative solutions that deliver real
            value. My journey in tech began with developing a neural network
            library in Java, which ignited my passion in this field. Since then,
            I've honed my skills to build not just AI-integrated websites, but
            also a range of applications that solve real-world problems and
            enhance user experiences. I'm committed to creating solutions that
            are technically proficient, meaningful, and impactful.
          </p>
          <p>
            My latest project is
            <a href="https://datupedia.onrender.com/" target="_blank"
              >Datupedia</a
            >, an open-source backlink analyzer for Wikipedia. This project
            showcases my ability to work with complex data and web technologies.
            My comprehensive skill set enables me to take projects from the
            initial concept stage all the way through to successful deployment,
            ensuring a complete and efficient development lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a strong foundation in diverse technologies ranging from web
            development to machine learning, I bring a versatile skill set and a
            problem-solving mindset to any project. My experience with various
            programming languages and frameworks equips me to adapt quickly to
            new challenges and collaborate effectively within a team. I'm not
            just about coding; I'm about creating solutions that add tangible
            value, driving projects forward with innovation and efficiency. My
            dedication to continuous learning and improvement ensures that I can
            contribute significantly to any team, adding both technical skill
            and a fresh perspective.

              In my solo project, an AI-integrated open-source Wikipedia
              backlink analyzer, I single-handedly conceptualized and developed
              the entire web application, focusing on "A tool for monitoring
              backlinks in knowledge graphs". My roles encompassed Front-end,
              Back-end, AI Engineering, and UX Design, showcasing my
              multifaceted skills in software development.

            <p>
              This Java Neural Network library stemmed from my quest for a
              transparent, in-depth understanding of machine learning
              frameworks. Frustrated by the superficial learning offered by
              popular tools, I sought to delve deeper. While successful in
              training models, I craved a thorough grasp of neural network
              mechanics. By creating this framework, I not only deepened my own
              understanding but also provided a valuable resource for others
              seeking a comprehensive, hands-on approach to understanding Neural
              Networks and machine learning.

            <p>I've always harbored a passion for games alongside my software/web development journey. This culminated in the creation of a game that not only showcases a custom-built Game Engine but also a game developed within that engine. The project uniquely includes Machine Learning integration, where the future states of the game are predicted by a sophisticated model. This integration not only enhances the gaming experience but also demonstrates the innovative use of AI in game development, merging my interests in both gaming and advanced technology.</p>
